    "\n",
    "Post-secondary education is an important and often necessary step in the desired career paths of many students in the USA. The cost to attend, however, is often a prohibiting factor. With fair variance in the cost of attendance between schools in different states, it's fairly common to see students move across the country to attend school where it is more affordable. As a result, tuition costs has long been a point of contention in the US political arena, and a central talking point in presidential elections. But for all of the talking and debating that occurs in TV and during campaigns, are schools in Democrat or Republican leaning areas actually cheaper or more expensive to attend?\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we are interested in **assessing whether there is a statistically significant difference between the average tuition cost in Republican-leaning states and Democrat-leaning states.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will investigate this using hypothesis testing on the difference of two population means, and also investigate the standard deviation of the difference in means to produce a confidence interval."

    "__3.1 Is this preliminary exploration good enough?__\n",
    "\n",
    "This report is based on a dataset of \"Average cost of the undergraduate student by state USA\" with observations ranging from 2013 to 2021. The exploratory data analysis filtered out the missing values from the dataset and categorized each state according to its political status. For our initial exploration, we only provided a simple comparison of two sample means, one from each group. It resulted in the finding that the mean tuition in Republican states is lower by 3431.759 USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_3.1.1 The Good Things_\n",
    "\n",
    "The preliminary result is alright for getting a rough glimpse into what the population means look like, and what their difference is. Albeit simple, the sample size (number of schools surveyed) is 246, which is a decent sample size to capture a fair proportion of the student population in the US. Given the sample size, it is unlikely that the sample means would have produced an outlandishly incorrect value. Further, the data is from a reliable source; its original source is the US Department of Education and the dataset was updated just a month ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_3.1.2 Why this is not enough, and what to do next_\n",
    "\n",
    "However, more is needed to conclude that the population means are in fact different since the difference in mean values between the two point estimates could simply be the result of sample variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more thorough analysis, we will use inferential statistics to conduct a hypothesis test to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the mean tuition of Democratic States and the average tuition of Republican States. This will be a two-tailed hypothesis test, where the null hypothesis is that the difference in population means equals zero, and the alternative hypothesis that it is not zero. We will use bootstrapping over the theoretical methods as a way to avoid making any assumptions about the distribution of the tuition costs in each population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we will calculate a confidence interval to estimate a range between which the difference in the means lies. This will also be completed using bootstrapping, wherein a bootstrap distribution is used to find the standard error, and to generate an interval.\n"

    "\n",
    "The political landscape in recent years is very polarised, and the issue of education has been a dividing issue between the two parties for a long time. Further, the preliminary results state a large gap between the tuition fees of the two groups. We expect to find a statistically significant difference between the average tuition of Democratic and Republican states. We also expect to find a confidence interval that describes that Republican costs are cheaper with at least a 90% confidence level."

    "\n",
    "There are many stakeholders that may be interested in the cost of tuition. Finding a statistically significant difference in the population means would be meaningful to skeptical politicians, journalists or citizens that may be concerned about whether all the discussion in debates translates to real action and impact. This may motivate activists to re-evaluate their strategies, politicians to assess more impactful programs/policies, and corporations to increase lobbying efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval describing the difference in tuition between Republican and Democrat states may better inform incoming students and their loved ones, who are concerned about finding education within their budget. It may also reveal that the efforts of some parties may be less/more effective than expected."

    "The findings of this study may contribute to identifying the true population means of the two parties' tuition costs, which may be useful for future statistical analyses. Namely, some further explorations may investigate the granular correlation between _how_ Republican or Democrat-leaning a state is and what their tuition costs are; perhaps through a scatterplot and a correlation coefficient. Another related study may assess the correlation between public opinion and tuition costs, as a way of measuring the impact that citizens have on their tuition costs."
